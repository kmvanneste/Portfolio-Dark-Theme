# Portfolio (Dark Theme)

This responsive portfolio is a mobile first web application designed to help me, Kristen Michelle Van Neste, display my coding projects and web development skills to future employers.  It has a dark theme consisting of a black background with blue highlights throughout.  For a more modern, less floral look, please check out my current portfolio pinned to my account page and listed in my repositories.
